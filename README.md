# RepoManager
RepoManager is a Python framework to analyze the historical changes of software systems stored in version control systems. We call this approach the change-based analysis of software repositories.

This approach was developed in the context of our master thesis. We validated different aspects of our change-based analysis by a comprehensive sample-based inspection. We provide detailed results of validating the sample sets (e.g. code artifacts, metric values, ratings, reasons), on our complementary [google docs document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LMwUOiO33gK4oeYTnHs4tAKA53Rp1NBLijPJ28WjEmI/edit?usp=sharing).

After defending my master thesis, we will publish the corresponding the framework.
